# Video Behavior Description Research Study

This application is designed to collect objective descriptions of videos using vector embeddings to account for complex verbal behavior. The study is conducted by Endicott College Institute for Applied Behavioral Science.

## Project Overview

This web application facilitates a research study where participants:
- Describe videos in an objective manner
- Help define and describe behaviors shown in videos
- The cosine similarity and dot product of the description of the embedding is compared to the description of the embedding of the video made by a human. 
- The score is then rendered back to the user. 
- The user gets 5 chances to increase their score. 
- Contribute to research evaluating novel methods for quantifying language

## Participation Details

- Participation is completely voluntary
- Participants must be 18 years or older
- We are using the platform [Prolific](https://www.prolific.co/) to collect data.
- We are providing monetary compensation for participation.
- All responses remain anonymous. Data is collected in a relational database on render, and then transfered, subsequently destroyed, and securely stored on Sharepoint.
